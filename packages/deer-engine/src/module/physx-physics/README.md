## TODO
  1. aggregate
  2. joints
  3. ccd
  4. raycast(rayCast / boxCast / capsuleCast / sphereCast / lineCast)
  5. overlapTest(overlapBox / overlapSphere / overlapCapsule)
  7. support trigger-trigger events (PxSceneFlag::eDEPRECATED_TRIGGER_TRIGGER_REPORTS has been deprecated in 4.x. Need use onContact to emulate triggers, and this supports trigger-trigger notifications and CCD, see SnippetTriggers in source code)
## FEATURE
  1. static / dynamic rigidbody
  2. box / sphere / capsule collider
